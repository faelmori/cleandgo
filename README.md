## **Installation**

### **Linux/Mac**

```bash
make install
```

### **Windows**

```powershell
.\install.bat
```

---

## **Usage**

### CLI

Here are some examples of commands you can execute with CleandGOâ€™s CLI:

```bash
# Parse a treeview file
cleandgo parse --source tree_views/tree_test.txt

# Backup a treeview file
cleandgo backup --tree tree_views/tree_test.txt

# Generate files and directories
cleandgo generate --output /my_project

# Serialize a processed version
cleandgo serialize --store version_1.clgo
```

---

## **Examples**

### **1. Parse a Treeview File**

```bash
cleandgo parse --source tree_views/tree_test.txt
```

This processes the treeview and transforms it into valid files and directories.

### **2. Backup a Treeview File**

```bash
cleandgo backup --tree tree_views/tree_test.txt
```

This creates a backup of the treeview for future recovery.

### **3. Generate Files and Directories**

```bash
cleandgo generate --output /my_project
```

This generates organized files and directories based on the treeview structure.

### **4. Serialize a Processed Version**

```bash
cleandgo serialize --store version_1.clgo
```

This saves the processed version for future use.
